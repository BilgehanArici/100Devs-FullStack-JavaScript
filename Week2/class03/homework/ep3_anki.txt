dont reply on discord directly reply on threads

why a tag doesnt need a closing tag?
its already content like images 
hello world is text we are wrapping around that text

why follow the rules of semantics and content rules? 
general users, accesibility devices, seo purposes

glitch changes the format of the image you upload to assets lol
cdn => content delivery network puts content to servers all around the world so you dont have to wait for that loading delay

root tag !
    anything inside of it is children
        parent child relationship

head everything browser needs
body everything we can see and interact with
you can see the body but you cant see whats going on inside your head

html (select html 5) + tab = root tag
! + tab = root tag

you want to indent the parent child relationships properly
