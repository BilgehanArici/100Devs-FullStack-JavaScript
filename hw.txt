A Coder is someone who writes code. This usually means program code, which makes him/her a programmer, but can be any type of code, e.g. HTML (the markup language making up webpages).

Anyone who develops anything IT-related is a Developer. This can involve programming, but can also be database design, user interface work, 3D modelling, you name it.

Anyone who applies the principles of software engineering is a Software Engineer. This usually involves a broad range of activities, ranging from requirements engineering and software design to documentation, version control, testing, and QA.
