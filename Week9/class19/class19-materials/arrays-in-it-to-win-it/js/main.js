//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let moviesArr = ['avengers','inception','batman']

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let firstMovie = moviesArr[0]

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let arrayLength = moviesArr.length
console.log(arrayLength)

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let lastElement = moviesArr[moviesArr.length-1]
